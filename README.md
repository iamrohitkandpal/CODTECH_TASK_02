## **Personal Insights**

This project was a great learning opportunity for building a full-stack application. Key takeaways include:
- **File Uploads**: Implementing file uploads using **express-fileupload** posed some challenges, but it was rewarding to manage images effectively.
- **Database Design**: Structuring MongoDB collections for flexible recipe and category management provided great insight into NoSQL databases.
  
Future plans for the project include:
- **User Authentication**: Implementing user authentication to allow users to manage their submitted recipes.
- **Enhanced Search Functionality**: Improving the search feature to support multiple filters (ingredients, difficulty level, etc.).
